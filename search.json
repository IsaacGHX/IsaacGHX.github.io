Below are several common methods, along with their pros and cons.\n\n1. Temporarily Modifying the [$PYTHONPATH] Environment Variable (Recommended)This is the most common and flexible method, as it only affects the current session or script execution.\nIn your terminal, navigate to the directory containing your Python modules, then run:\nexport PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)\nExplanation:\n\nexport PYTHONPATH: This Linux command is used to set or modify the PYTHONPATH environment variable. Python checks the paths defined in this variable when searching for modules.\n$(pwd): This is a command substitution; the pwd command outputs the absolute path of the current working directory. $(pwd) uses its output as an argument for the export command.\n\nExample:\nAssume your file structure is like this:\nmy_project/├── main.py└── my_module.py\nmy_module.py content:\ndef hello():    print(&quot;Hello from my_module!&quot;)\nmain.py content:\nimport my_modulemy_module.hello()\n\nEnter the my_project directory:cd my_project\nSet PYTHONPATH:export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)\nRun main.py:python main.py\nYou should see the output “Hello from my_module!“\n\nPros:\n\nNon-invasive: Only effective for the current terminal session or script, does not permanently alter system configuration.\nFlexible: Suitable for any scenario requiring temporary path additions.\n\nCons:\n\nNeeds to be set again every time you open a new terminal session.\n\n\n2. Adding Path via [sys.path.append()] in Python ScriptYou can also directly add the current directory to the module search path at the beginning of your Python script.\nimport sysimport os# Add the directory containing the current script to Python&#x27;s search path# os.path.dirname(__file__) gets the directory of the current script# os.path.abspath() gets the absolute pathcurrent_dir = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))if current_dir not in sys.path:    sys.path.append(current_dir)# Now you can import modules from the current directoryimport your_module_name\nPros:\n\nSelf-contained: Handled automatically when the script runs, no external commands needed.\nPortable: The script can run in any environment without additional setup.\n\nCons:\n\nRequires adding this code to every script that needs this functionality.\nIf modules are in subdirectories of the current directory, it requires more complex path handling.\n\n\n3. Using the [-m] Option (for Executable Modules/Packages)If your Python structure is an executable package, you can use the -m option to run a module. This automatically handles module path issues.\nFor example, if your my_project structure looks like this:\nmy_project/├── __init__.py└── my_script.py\nAnd you want to run my_script.py:\npython -m my_project.my_script\nPros:\n\nSuitable for building executable packages.\nPython handles paths automatically.\n\nCons:\n\nRequires your code to be organized as a Python package (i.e., include an __init__.py file).\n\n\nSummaryFor most temporary development and testing scenarios, the first method (export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)) is the most concise and recommended. It allows you to run Python scripts directly in the current directory and import sibling modules without modifying the script itself.\nIf you need a more robust solution, such as building a large project, it’s typically recommended to use a Python package structure and manage module dependencies and paths via pip install -e . (editable install) or by building a setup.py file.\n","tags":["ENV"]},{"title":"Configure Clash Nyanpasu on Linux","url":"/2025/07/27/fast_startup/Configure-Clash-Nyanpasu-on-Linux/","content":"Choosing and Setting up Clash.Nyanpasu Client on Linux\n\nThis guide will walk you through setting up Clash.Nyanpasu on a Linux server without a graphical user interface. We’ll use the Mihomo core, and you’ll learn how to manage your proxy settings via the command line.\nWe recommend using Clash.Nyanpasu for its robust features and active development.\n1. Determine Your System ArchitectureFirst, identify your Linux server’s architecture to download the correct AppImage. For example, if you have an x86_64 Ubuntu server, you’ll download the amd64.AppImage.\nTo find your architecture, use the command:\nuname -m\nThis will output something like x86_64, aarch64, etc.\n2. Download Clash.NyanpasuNavigate to the Clash.Nyanpasu releases page. Find the latest pre-release or stable release and locate the .AppImage file corresponding to your architecture.\nFor example, for x86_64 (also known as amd64), you might download:\nwget https://github.com/libnyanpasu/clash-nyanpasu/releases/download/pre-release/Clash.Nyanpasu_2.0.0-alpha+2c587d0_amd64.AppImage\nRemember to replace the URL with the specific version you are downloading.\n3. Extract the AppImageAppImages are self-contained executables. While they can often be run directly on systems with FUSE set up, on servers without a graphical environment, you might encounter issues like:\n$ ./Clash.Nyanpasu_2.0.0-alpha+2c587d0_amd64.AppImagefuse: device not found, try &#x27;modprobe fuse&#x27; firstCannot mount AppImage, please check your FUSE setup.You might still be able to extract the contents of this AppImageif you run it with the --appimage-extract option.See https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/wiki/FUSEfor more informationopen dir error: No such file or directory\nAnd sudo modprobe fuse might not work if modprobe is not in your PATH or if you don’t have the necessary kernel modules.\nTo proceed without FUSE, extract the AppImage’s contents:\nchmod +x Clash.Nyanpasu_2.0.0-alpha+2c587d0_amd64.AppImage./Clash.Nyanpasu_2.0.0-alpha+2c587d0_amd64.AppImage --appimage-extract\nThis will create a squashfs-root directory in your current location.\n4. Prepare Configuration Files4.1 Locate the Mihomo ExecutableAfter extraction, the Mihomo core executable (which Clash.Nyanpasu uses) will be located within the squashfs-root directory. Based on the example, it’s typically found at:\n/workspace/squashfs-root/usr/bin/mihomo\n(Note: The path in your system might vary if you extracted it elsewhere. Adjust /workspace/ accordingly.)\n4.2 Create Configuration DirectoryCreate a directory for your Clash configuration files. We’ll use /etc/clash/ as the default in this guide:\nsudo mkdir -p /etc/clash\n4.3 Copy Configuration FilesCopy your config.yaml file (which you should have prepared beforehand, containing your proxy settings) into the /etc/clash/ directory.\nsudo cp /path/to/your/config.yaml /etc/clash/config.yaml\nReplace /path/to/your/config.yaml with the actual path to your configuration file.\n4.4 GeoIP Database (MMDB)Clash uses a GeoIP database (Country.mmdb) for IP-based routing. If you don’t have one, you’ll need to download it. Mihomo typically expects it in the same directory as your config.yaml.\nYou can download Country.mmdb from sources like:\n\nOfficial MaxMind GeoLite2: You need to register for a free account to download GeoLite2-Country.mmdb, then rename it to Country.mmdb.\nThird-party Mirrors (use with caution and verify integrity): Some Clash-related projects provide direct downloads. Search for “Country.mmdb download clash” to find reputable sources.\n\nOnce downloaded, copy it to your configuration directory:\nsudo cp /path/to/your/Country.mmdb /etc/clash/Country.mmdb\n5. Configure Shell EnvironmentTo easily manage Clash and proxy settings, add the following functions to your ~/.bashrc file. This allows you to start Clash, and enable/disable proxy settings with simple commands.\nOpen ~/.bashrc with your preferred editor (e.g., nano or vim):\nnano ~/.bashrc\nAdd the following lines to the end of the file:\n# --- Clash Functions ---clash() &#123;    local MIHOMO_BIN=&quot;/workspace/squashfs-root/usr/bin/mihomo&quot; # Adjust this path if necessary    local DEFAULT_CONFIG_DIR=&quot;/etc/clash/&quot;    local CUSTOM_CONFIG_DIR=&quot;$1&quot; # First argument can be a custom config directory    # Check if mihomo executable exists    if [ ! -f &quot;$MIHOMO_BIN&quot; ]; then        echo &quot;Error: Mihomo executable not found at $MIHOMO_BIN&quot; &gt;&amp;2 # Output to standard error        return 1 # Return non-zero status code for failure    fi    # Determine which config directory to use    local CONFIG_TO_USE=&quot;$DEFAULT_CONFIG_DIR&quot;    if [ -n &quot;$CUSTOM_CONFIG_DIR&quot; ]; then # If a custom config directory is provided        CONFIG_TO_USE=&quot;$CUSTOM_CONFIG_DIR&quot;        echo &quot;Using custom configuration directory: $CONFIG_TO_USE&quot;    else        echo &quot;Using default configuration directory: $DEFAULT_CONFIG_DIR&quot;    fi    # Check if the config directory exists    if [ ! -d &quot;$CONFIG_TO_USE&quot; ]; then        echo &quot;Error: Clash configuration directory not found at $CONFIG_TO_USE&quot; &gt;&amp;2        echo &quot;Please ensure this directory exists and contains a config.yaml file.&quot; &gt;&amp;2        return 1    fi    echo &quot;Starting Mihomo...&quot;    # Using exec ensures mihomo replaces the current shell process, so when mihomo exits, the function also ends.    # If you want mihomo to run in the background, remove &#x27;exec&#x27; and add &#x27;&amp;&#x27; at the end.    &quot;$MIHOMO_BIN&quot; -d &quot;$CONFIG_TO_USE&quot; &quot;$@&quot;    # &quot;$@&quot; passes all arguments of the function to mihomo, allowing you to run: clash /path/to/my/config --port 7890    echo &quot;Mihomo started or exited.&quot;&#125;# --- Proxy Control Functions ---# Define a function to set system proxy to Clashproxy_on() &#123;    # Check if Clash&#x27;s listening port is provided, otherwise use default    local CLASH_PORT=$&#123;1:-7890&#125; # Default port is 7890    echo &quot;Setting HTTP/HTTPS proxy to Clash (Port: $CLASH_PORT)...&quot;    # Set HTTP and HTTPS proxy environment variables    # Ensure you use your actual Clash listening address, usually 127.0.0.1 (localhost)    export http_proxy=&quot;http://127.0.0.1:$CLASH_PORT&quot;    export https_proxy=&quot;http://127.0.0.1:$CLASH_PORT&quot;    # It&#x27;s also often recommended to set all_proxy to cover more applications (e.g., curl)    export all_proxy=&quot;socks5://127.0.0.1:$CLASH_PORT&quot; # Clash also listens on SOCKS5 proxy    # Set addresses that should not use the proxy, typically including localhost and private network addresses    # Traffic to these addresses usually doesn&#x27;t need to be proxied and could cause issues otherwise    export no_proxy=&quot;localhost,127.0.0.1,::1,*.local,10.0.0.0/8,172.16.0.0/12,192.168.0.0/16&quot;    echo &quot;Proxy set successfully!&quot;    echo &quot;   http_proxy: $http_proxy&quot;    echo &quot;   https_proxy: $https_proxy&quot;    echo &quot;   all_proxy: $all_proxy&quot;    echo &quot;   no_proxy: $no_proxy&quot;&#125;# Define a function to turn off the proxyproxy_off() &#123;    echo &quot;Turning off HTTP/HTTPS proxy...&quot;    # Unset proxy environment variables    unset http_proxy    unset https_proxy    unset all_proxy    unset no_proxy    echo &quot;Proxy turned off.&quot;&#125;\nSave the file and exit the editor.\nApply the changes to your current session:\nsource ~/.bashrc\n6. Running Clash with TMUXSince you’re on a server without a GUI, you’ll want to run Clash in a detached session so it continues running even after you close your terminal. tmux is an excellent tool for this.\n\nStart a new tmux session:\ntmux new -s clash\nYou are now inside a new tmux session named clash.\n\nStart Clash:\nInside the tmux session, run the clash function you defined:\nclash\nYou should see output indicating Mihomo is starting.\n\nDetach from the tmux session:\nPress Ctrl+b then d. You will be returned to your main shell, and Clash will continue running in the background within the tmux session.\n\n\n7. Controlling the ProxyFrom any other terminal window on your server (or your main shell after detaching from tmux):\n\nTo enable the proxy:\nproxy_on\nYou can optionally specify a port if your Clash instance is listening on something other than 7890: proxy_on 8888.\n\nTo disable the proxy:\nproxy_off\n\n\n8. Managing the Clash Session\nTo reattach to the Clash tmux session:\ntmux attach -t clash\n\nTo stop Clash:\nIf you are attached to the clash, you can stop Clash by pressing Ctrl+c in the terminal where Clash is running. This will terminate the Mihomo process and close the tmux pane.\n\nTo kill the tmux session (and Clash running within it):\ntmux kill-session -t clash\n\n\nThis comprehensive setup allows you to efficiently manage Clash.Nyanpasu and your proxy settings on a headless Linux server.\n","tags":["Network","VPS"]},{"title":"tmux Quickstart","url":"/2025/08/21/fast_startup/Tmux-quick-start/","content":"\nGetting Started with [tmux] for a Powerful Terminaltmux is a terminal multiplexer, a powerful tool that transforms your terminal into a persistent, multi-window workspace. It’s an essential utility for anyone working on remote servers or managing multiple tasks in the command line. Think of it as adding tabs and session-saving capabilities to your terminal.\n\nInstalling [tmux]Getting tmux is straightforward on most systems.\n\nOn macOS (with Homebrew):brew install tmux\nOn Debian / Ubuntu:sudo apt updatesudo apt install tmux\nOn CentOS / RHEL / Fedora:sudo dnf install tmux\n\n\n\nManaging Sessions and Windowstmux commands are triggered by a prefix key, which is Ctrl + b by default. To send a command, you press the prefix, release it, and then press the command key.\nCreating and Managing SessionsA session is a collection of windows that can be detached and re-attached later.\n\nStart a new named session:tmux new -s my_project\nDetach from the current session:This leaves the session running in the background.Press Ctrl + b, then d.\n\nList all running sessions:\ntmux ls\n\nRe-attach to a session:\ntmux attach -t my_project\n\n\nManaging Windows (like browser tabs)Within a session, you can have multiple windows for different tasks.\n\nCreate a new window:Press Ctrl + b, then c.\n\nSwitch between windows:\n\nCtrl + b, then n (next window)\nCtrl + b, then p (previous window)\nCtrl + b, then 0 (switch to window 0)\n\n\nRename the current window:Press Ctrl + b, then , (comma).\n\nClose the current window:Press Ctrl + b, then &amp;.\n\n\n\nBrowsing Command History and BufferSometimes, the output of a command is too long to fit on one screen. tmux has a special “copy mode” that lets you scroll up and view your history.\n\nEnter Copy Mode (Scroll Mode):Press Ctrl + b, then [ (left square bracket).\n\nNavigate the buffer:Once in copy mode, you can use your arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) or Vim-style keys (k for up, j for down) to scroll freely through the entire command output history of that pane.\n\nExit Copy Mode:Press q to return to the normal command prompt.\n\n\n\nManaging [tmux] from the OutsideYou don’t have to be inside a tmux session to manage it. You can use command-line flags to get information or to stop sessions and windows.\n\nList all sessions and their windows (detailed view):The ls command is your primary tool for this.\ntmux ls\n\nDelete a specific session from outside:If you want to completely shut down a session and all the processes within it, use kill-session.\ntmux kill-session -t my_project\nReplace my_project with the name or ID of the session you want to delete.\n\nDelete a specific window from outside:This is less common, but you can target a specific window to close it. You need to specify the target using the format [session_name]:[window_index].\ntmux kill-window -t my_project:1\n this command will kill window 1 in the ‘my_project’ session \n\n\n\n[tmux] Structure RelationshipTo help you visualize how everything fits together, here is a simple diagram. The tmux server runs in the background. It can manage multiple sessions. Each session acts as a workspace containing one or more windows (like tabs). Finally, each window can be split into one or more panes.\n[ tmux Server (background process) ]||-----\\&gt; [ Session: project\\_A ]|           ||           |-----\\&gt; [ Window 0: bash ] --\\&gt; (Pane 0: vim)|           ||           |-----\\&gt; [ Window 1: logs ] --\\&gt; (Pane 0: tail -f)|           |                          --\\&gt; (Pane 1: htop)|           ||           &#x27;-----\\&gt; [ Window 2: zsh ]  --\\&gt; (Pane 0: zsh)|&#x27;-----\\&gt; [ Session: project\\_B ]||-----\\&gt; [ Window 0: main ] --\\&gt; (Pane 0: python)|&#x27;-----\\&gt; [ Window 1: db ]   --\\&gt; (Pane 0: psql)\n\nKey [tmux] Features ExplainedWhat makes tmux so indispensable?\n\nSession Persistence: This is the killer feature. When you detach or your SSH connection drops, the tmux server keeps your session and all its running processes alive in the background. You can reconnect later and find everything exactly as you left it.\n\nEnvironment Variable Isolation: When you export an environment variable in one tmux pane or window, it is not automatically available in other existing or new windows/panes. Each new window starts with a clean environment, preventing variables from one task from accidentally affecting another. This ensures a predictable and isolated workspace for each command.\n\nBackgrounding: The ability to detach (Ctrl + b, d) and leave tasks running is crucial for long-running processes like code compilation, data processing, or server maintenance. You can start a job, detach, close your local terminal, and re-attach hours later from a different machine to check the progress.\n\nPanes and Layouts: Beyond windows, you can split a single window into multiple panes (horizontal: Ctrl + b, &quot;; vertical: Ctrl + b, %) to view logs, edit code, and run commands all at once.\n\n\n\n[tmux] makes your terminal persistent and powerful =w=/","tags":["ENV, CLI"]},{"title":"V-PS VLESS-REALITY 代理部署与客户端配置指南","url":"/2025/07/07/fast_startup/V-PS-VLESS-REALITY-%E4%BB%A3%E7%90%86%E9%83%A8%E7%BD%B2%E4%B8%8E%E5%AE%A2%E6%88%B7%E7%AB%AF%E9%85%8D%E7%BD%AE%E6%8C%87%E5%8D%97/","content":"远程服务器 VLESS-REALITY 代理部署与客户端配置指南本文档将指导您完成以下全部流程：\n\n在 AWS Lightsail VPS 上进行基础设置和安全加固。\n部署 Xray-core 并配置 VLESS-REALITY 服务。\n在本地生成客户端所需的 YAML 配置文件。\n通过 GitHub Gist 发布配置文件，生成可供订阅的 HTTP 链接。\n提供一个一键生成本地 YAML 文件的脚本。\n\n\n1. 简介与准备工作1.1 VPS 推荐：AWS Lightsail对于需要稳定、高质量国际网络连接的学术和研究用途，AWS Lightsail 是一个优秀的选择。\n关键步骤：\n\n前往 AWS Lightsail官网 创建一个实例。推荐选择位于东京或新加坡等低延迟地区的实例。\n在实例的管理面板中，进入“网络”选项卡，务必创建一个静态 IP 地址并将其附加到您的实例。这是确保您的服务地址不会因重启而改变的关键。\n\n1.2 VLESS 与 REALITY 协议简述VLESS 是一个性能卓越、配置灵活的轻量级传输协议。它本身不包含加密，将加密的责任交给了底层传输层（如 TLS），实现了“权责分离”，从而获得了极高的性能和可扩展性。\nREALITY (REgular-expression based Application Layer proxy for Inbound TLSY) 是一种革命性的 TLS 代理技术。它通过“借用”一个真实、有效的目标网站的 TLS 证书来伪装流量，解决了传统代理需要购买域名和申请证书的痛点。当流量被审查时，它看起来就像是用户在直接访问一个普通的、知名的大型网站（例如 www.bing.com），从而为学术数据传输和网络研究提供了极佳的隐蔽性和稳定性。\n1.3 为什么不推荐使用 Cloudflare 代理？对于 VLESS-REALITY 这种旨在模仿真实用户直接访问目标网站的协议，不应该再套一层 Cloudflare 代理。原因如下：\n\n特征冲突：Cloudflare 的代理是为隐藏服务器真实 IP、抗 DDoS 等场景设计的，其流量特征（如特定的 TLS 指纹、IP段）非常明显。这与 REALITY 试图模仿直接连接的初衷相悖。\n显著增加延迟：所有流量都需要先经过 Cloudflare 的全球网络再到达您的服务器，相当于进行了一次不必要的中转。这会显著增加网络延迟（通常增加 30%-50% 或更高），降低连接速度和响应性。\n功能性问题：\n过多重定向：可能导致某些服务（如 cn.bing.com 的搜索）失败。\n人机验证失败：许多网站使用 Cloudflare 的服务来防御机器人，当您的代理流量也通过 Cloudflare 时，可能会触发更严格的人机验证，甚至无法通过。\n\n\n\n\n2. 服务器准备与安全加固2.1 更新系统通过 SSH 连接到您的服务器，并执行以下命令，确保所有软件包都是最新的。\nsudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade -y\n2.2 防火墙加固 (UFW)我们将采用“默认拒绝”策略，只放行必要的端口。\n\n设置默认策略：\nsudo ufw default deny incomingsudo ufw default allow outgoing\n\n允许 SSH 和 Xray 端口：\n\n22 是默认 SSH 端口，443 是我们将要使用的 Xray 服务端口。\n重要：如果您计划修改 SSH 端口（强烈推荐），请务必先允许新端口，再禁用旧端口。例如，将 SSH 端口改为 7777。\n\n\n# 允许你自定义的SSH端口sudo ufw allow 7777/tcp# 允许 Xray 服务端口sudo ufw allow 443/tcp# 如果您确认新的SSH端口可以登录，可以禁用默认的22端口# sudo ufw deny 22/tcp\n\n注意：请务必检查云服务商（如 AWS Lightsail）自带的网络防火墙规则，确保上述端口（7777 和 443）也已对公网开放。为了省心，您可以选择允许所有 TCP/UDP 端口（0-65535）的流量，但这会降低安全性。\n\n\n启用并检查状态：\nsudo ufw enablesudo ufw status verbose\n当看到 Status: active 和您添加的规则列表时，表示防火墙已成功启动。\n\n\n2.3 (可选但强烈推荐) SSH 安全强化\n创建新用户并授予 sudo 权限：\n# 将 your_username 替换为您想用的用户名adduser your_usernameusermod -aG sudo your_username\n\n配置 SSH 密钥认证：\n\n在您自己的电脑上生成 SSH 密钥对。\n将公钥 (~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 的内容) 复制到服务器上新用户的 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys 文件中。\n确保您能通过密钥免密登录新用户后，再进行下一步。\n\n\n修改 SSH 配置文件：\nsudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n找到并修改以下参数：\n# 将端口从 22 改为 1024-65535 之间的任意端口Port 7777# 禁止 root 用户远程登录PermitRootLogin no# 禁用密码认证，强制使用密钥登录PasswordAuthentication no\n\n检查云服务商的覆盖配置：检查 /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/ 目录下是否有云服务商的配置文件（如 50-cloud-init.conf）。如果该文件强制 PasswordAuthentication yes，请将其修改为 no 或删除该文件。\n\n重启 SSH 服务：\nsudo systemctl restart ssh\n现在，您需要使用新的端口和密钥才能登录服务器。\n\n\n2.4 网络性能优化：启用 TCP BBRBBR 算法能显著改善长距离、高延迟网络下的连接速度和吞吐量。\n\n修改系统控制参数：\nsudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf\n在文件末尾添加以下两行：\nnet.core.default_qdisc=fqnet.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control=bbr\n\n应用并验证配置：\n# 使配置立即生效sudo sysctl -p# 验证 BBR 是否已启用sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control\n如果输出结果为 net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control = bbr，则表示配置成功。\n\n注意：一些云服务商（如 AWS Lightsail）默认就允许了，也是好事。\n\n\n\n\n3. 核心服务部署：Xray-core3.1 安装 Xray-core使用官方一键安装脚本来安装最新版本。\nbash -c &quot;$(curl -L [https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-install/raw/main/install-release.sh](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-install/raw/main/install-release.sh))&quot; @ install\n3.2 生成必要凭证在配置前，我们需要生成一个 UUID 和一对 REALITY 密钥。\n\n生成 UUID：\n/usr/local/bin/xray uuid\n\n记录下这串唯一的字符串，例如 xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx。\n\n\n生成 REALITY 密钥对：\n/usr/local/bin/xray x25519\n\n这会同时输出 私钥 (PrivateKey) 和 公钥 (PublicKey)。请务必妥善保存这两个密钥。私钥用于服务器配置，公钥用于客户端配置。\n\n\n\n3.3 编写 config.json 配置文件使用以下内容完全替换 /usr/local/etc/xray/config.json 文件。\nsudo nano /usr/local/etc/xray/config.json\n完整配置示例 (config.json)：\n&#123;

It’s a great alternative to pip and virtualenv, speeding up your workflow significantly. Let’s get you set up and show you how to use it.\n\nInstalling [uv]: Three WaysYou’ve got a few simple options for getting uv onto your system:\n\nRecommended (with pipx): This is the best way as it installs uv in its own isolated environment, preventing conflicts with other packages.pip install pipx # If you don&#x27;t have pipx alreadypipx ensurepath    # Make sure pipx&#x27;s executables are on your PATHpipx install uv\nDirectly with pip: A straightforward way if you prefer not to use pipx.pip install uv\nUsing brew (macOS/Linux): If you’re on macOS or Linux and use Homebrew, it’s just one command.brew install uv\n\n\n\nSetting Up and Activating a Virtual Environmentuv makes managing virtual environments a breeze, keeping your project dependencies neatly separated.\nCreating the EnvironmentTo create a new virtual environment in your current directory (it’ll be named .venv by default):\nuv venv\nor you can assign specific version of Python\nuv venv -p 3.10\nActivating the EnvironmentBefore you do anything else in your project, you need to activate this environment:\n\nmacOS/Linux:source .venv/bin/activate\nWindows (Command Prompt):.venv\\Scripts\\activate.bat\nWindows (PowerShell):.venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1\n\n\nYou’ll know it’s active because your terminal prompt will usually show (.venv) at the beginning.\nExit can use following:deactivate\nDelete the .venv directory:rm -rf .venv\n\nInstalling Packages with [uv pip install]Once your virtual environment is active, installing packages is very similar to pip, but with uv pip:\n\nInstalling from requirements.txt:uv pip install -r requirements.txt\nInstalling individual packages:uv pip install requests beautifulsoup4\n\n\nImportant Note on Quoting with [uv pip]When installing packages that include extras (optional features) or direct URLs, you must use double quotes to ensure the shell passes the entire string correctly to uv. This is a common point of confusion for pip users moving to uv.\n\nWith extras:uv pip install &quot;celery[redis]&quot;\nFrom a Git repository:uv pip install &quot;git+https://github.com/example/my-lib.git#egg=my-lib&quot;\nLocal editable installs:uv pip install &quot;-e .&quot;\n\n\n\nRunning Your Project with [uv]’s PythonAfter your environment is active and dependencies are installed, you simply use the python command, which now refers to the Python interpreter within your activated .venv.\nIf you have a script named app.py:\npython app.py\nKey point: You don’t use uv python (that command doesn’t exist). Once the environment is activated, your shell automatically uses the python from your .venv.\n\nWhat Makes [uv] Special?uv isn’t just another package manager; it brings some powerful features to the table:\n\nBlazing Speed: This is uv‘s headline feature. Written in Rust, it’s significantly faster than pip for dependency resolution and installation, especially in large, complex projects.\n\nRobust Dependency Resolution: uv is designed to handle complex dependency graphs and potential conflicts much more effectively than pip, leading to more reliable builds.\n\nNo Global Lock (for venvs): Unlike some other tools, uv doesn’t enforce a global lock file across all your virtual environments.

-n 20 &lt;文件名&gt;: 查看文件的前20行。\ntail -f &lt;日志文件名&gt;: 实时监控文件末尾的新增内容，常用于看日志。\n\n\n系统与进程信息\npwd: 显示当前工作目录。\n\ndf -h: 查看磁盘空间使用情况。\n\ndu -sh &lt;路径&gt;: 查看指定目录或文件的总大小。\n\n高级用法：列出当前目录内容大小并排序\n这个功能需要组合多个命令，通过管道 | 连接。\n列出最大的10个文件/目录:du -h --max-depth=1 . | sort -rh | head -n 10\n\ndu -h --max-depth=1 .: 计算当前目录下(.)第一层(--max-depth=1)所有文件和目录的大小。\nsort -rh: r表示逆序(从大到小)，h表示按人类可读数值(K,M,G)排序。\nhead -n 10: 取排序后的前10行。\n\n\n列出最小的10个文件/目录 (不含当前目录.):du -h --max-depth=1 . | sort -h | tail -n 11 | head -n 10\n\n\n\n\n\ntop / htop: 动态显示系统进程和资源占用。htop 更直观，推荐。\n\nkill &lt;进程ID&gt;: 终止一个进程 (-9 为强制终止)。\n\n\n\n网络操作\nping &lt;主机名或IP&gt;: 测试网络连通性。\nwget &lt;URL&gt;: 从指定 URL 下载文件。\ncurl ifconfig.me: 查看你的公网IP地址。\n\n\n用户与SSH管理这是系统管理的核心部分，所有操作几乎都需要 sudo。\n\n添加新用户\n\n使用交互式命令添加用户，会引导你设置密码和其他信息。sudo adduser new_username\n\n\n\n用户分组\n\n将用户添加到某个组（例如 sudo 组，使其能执行 sudo 命令）。sudo usermod -aG sudo new_username\n\n-a (append) 表示追加，-G 表示指定次要组。\n\n\n查看用户所属的组:groups new_username\n\n\n\n设置和确认SSH登录 (推荐使用密钥登录)\n\n第1步 (服务器): 安装SSH服务sudo apt updatesudo apt install openssh-server# 检查服务状态，确保 active (running)sudo systemctl status ssh\n第2步 (你的本地电脑): 生成SSH密钥\n如果你的本地电脑上还没有密钥 (~/.ssh/id_rsa不存在)，执行此命令。一路回车即可。\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096\n\n\n第3步 (你的本地电脑): 将公钥复制到服务器\n这是最关键的一步，它会自动将你的公钥追加到服务器上对应用户的 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys 文件中。\nssh-copy-id new_username@服务器IP地址\n\n\n第4步 (服务器): 提升安全性 (可选但强烈推荐)\n禁止密码登录，只允许密钥登录。\n编辑SSH配置文件: sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n找到 PasswordAuthentication yes 这一行，把它改成 PasswordAuthentication no。\n保存 (Ctrl+O) 并退出 (Ctrl+X)。\n重启SSH服务使配置生效:sudo systemctl restart ssh\n\n\n第5步: 确认登录\n现在你可以无需密码，直接通过密钥登录服务器了。\nssh new_username@服务器IP地址\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n权限与管理\nsudo &lt;命令&gt;: 以超级用户 (root) 权限执行命令。\nchmod &lt;权限模式&gt; &lt;文件名&gt;: 更改文件或目录的权限。\n常用示例: chmod 755 script.sh (赋予所有者读/写/执行权限，其他用户读/执行权限)。\n\n\n\n好的，这是一个专门介绍“搜索与匹配”的独立部分。这部分命令是 Linux 系统管理和日常使用中最高频、最强大的工具之一。\n\n搜索与匹配在复杂的系统中，快速定位文件、查找特定内容或检查进程状态至关重要。find、grep 等命令的组合使用，能极大地提升工作效率。\n=w= 请搭配 正则表达式快速入门到进阶Blog 食用\n1. 按名称和属性查找文件: findfind 命令用于在目录结构中搜索文件，并执行指定的操作。它的强大之处在于可以根据文件的各种属性（名称、类型、大小、修改时间等）进行精细化查找。\n基本语法: find [搜索路径] [表达式选项]\n应用场景举例:\n\n场景一：查找特定的配置文件\n\n需求：服务器上部署了很多服务，你想找到所有名为 nginx.conf 的配置文件。\n应用：# 从根目录 / 开始搜索sudo find / -name &quot;nginx.conf&quot;\n\n/：指定搜索的起始路径为整个系统。\n-name：按文件名进行精确匹配。\n\n\n\n\n场景二：清理临时的备份文件\n\n需求：查找并删除所有由开发者或编辑器自动生成的以 .bak 结尾的备份文件。\n应用：# 在当前项目目录 . 中查找所有 .bak 文件find . -name &quot;*.bak&quot;# 找到后直接删除（请谨慎操作！）find . -name &quot;*.bak&quot; -exec rm &#123;&#125; \\;\n\n*：是通配符，&quot;*.bak&quot; 匹配所有以 .bak 结尾的名称。\n-exec rm &#123;&#125; \\;：是对找到的每个结果 &#123;&#125; 执行 rm 命令。\n\n\n\n\n场景三：按文件类型查找\n\n需求：你只想查找所有名为 project 的目录，而不是同名的文件。\n应用：find . -type d -name &quot;project&quot;\n\n-type d：指定查找类型为目录 (directory)。相应地，-type f 表示只查找普通文件 (file)。\n\n\n\n\n场景四：查找近期修改过的文件\n\n需求：排查问题时，需要查看 /etc 目录下最近24小时内被修改过的所有文件。\n应用：find /etc -mtime -1\n\n-mtime -1：表示修改时间 (Modification Time) 在1天（24小时）之内。+1 则表示超过1天。\n\n\n\n\n场景五：查找占用空间的大文件\n\n需求：磁盘空间告急，需要找出系统中所有超过 500MB 的大文件。\n应用：find / -type f -size +500M\n\n-size +500M：表示文件大小 (size) 超过 (+) 500兆字节 (M)。\n\n\n\n\n\n2. 在文件内容中搜索文本: grepgrep (Global Regular Expression Print) 是最强大的文本搜索工具，用于在文件内容中查找包含指定模式（字符串或正则表达式）的行。\n基本语法: grep [选项] &quot;要搜索的模式&quot; [文件名]\n应用场景举例:\n\n场景一：检查配置项\n\n需求：确认 SSH 服务的监听端口号。\n应用：grep &quot;Port&quot; /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n\n这会从指定文件中找出所有包含 “Port” 字符串的行。\n\n\n\n\n场景二：在代码库中全局搜索\n\n需求：作为一名开发者，你想在整个项目代码中查找某个函数名或变量 getUserProfile 的所有引用。\n应用：grep -r &quot;getUserProfile&quot; .\n\n-r (recursive)：递归地搜索当前目录 (.) 及其所有子目录下的文件。\n-i：如果需要忽略大小写（同时匹配 getuserprofile），可以使用 grep -ri ...。\n\n\n\n\n场景三：分析日志文件\n\n需求：你需要从巨大的系统日志中，筛选出所有关于 “error” 的记录来进行故障分析。\n应用：grep -i &quot;error&quot; /var/log/syslog\n\n\n\n场景四：过滤命令的输出（管道 | 的威力）\n\n需求：ls -l 命令列出的文件太多，你只想看其中和 python 相关的文件。\n应用：ls -l | grep &quot;python&quot;\n\n管道符 | 将前一个命令 (ls -l) 的输出，作为后一个命令 (grep) 的输入。这是 Linux 中最核心、最强大的特性之一。\n\n\n\n\n场景五：反向匹配\n\n需求：查看一个配置文件，但想隐藏所有以 # 开头的注释行，只看有效的配置。\n应用：grep -v &quot;^#&quot; /etc/nginx/nginx.conf\n\n-v (invert-match)：反向匹配，即输出所有不包含指定模式的行。\n^# 是一个简单的正则表达式，^ 表示一行的开始。\n\n\n\n\n\n3. 查找正在运行的进程\n场景一：快速检查服务是否在运行\n\n需求：确认 nginx 服务是否已经成功启动。\n传统方式: ps aux | grep &quot;nginx&quot;\nps aux：列出系统中所有正在运行的进程。\ngrep &quot;nginx&quot;：从进程列表中筛选出含 “nginx” 的行。\n（缺点：通常会把 grep 命令本身也搜出来）。\n\n\n现代方式: pgrep\npgrep 是专门用于按名称查找进程ID (PID) 的命令，更简洁、准确。\n应用：pgrep nginx\n如果返回一个或多个数字（进程ID），说明服务正在运行。如果无任何返回，则表示服务未运行。\n\n\n\n\n场景二：找到进程并获取其详细信息\n\n需求：你用 pgrep 找到了 nginx 的进程ID，现在想看这个进程的完整信息（如启动用户、CPU占用等）。\n应用：# pgrep 的输出可以被其他命令直接使用ps -f -p $(pgrep nginx)\n\n$(...)：命令替换，它会先执行括号里的 pgrep nginx 命令，然后将其输出（即进程ID）作为 ps -p 命令的参数。\n\n\n\n\n\n","tags":["ENV","Linux"]},{"title":"Brief Reinforcement Learning 02 - Decentralized Advantage-based Policy Optimization (DAPO)

仓库)[https://huggingface.co/datasets/IPF/AIME25-CoT-CN]\n\nI-1. 求所有整数底数 b>9 的和，使得 17_b 是 97_b 的因数。解：\n首先，我们将以 b 为底的数转换为以 10 为底的数：\n17_b = 1 \\cdot b^1 + 7 \\cdot b^0 = b+797_b = 9 \\cdot b^1 + 7 \\cdot b^0 = 9b+7问题所给的条件是 17_b 整除 97_b，这意味着 (b+7) 必须是 (9b+7) 的因数。\n因此，分数 \\frac{9b+7}{b+7} 必须是一个整数。\n我们对该分数进行代数变形：\n\\frac{9b+7}{b+7} = \\frac{9(b+7) - 63 + 7}{b+7} = \\frac{9(b+7) - 56}{b+7} = 9 - \\frac{56}{b+7}因为 9 是一个整数，所以要使整个表达式为整数，\\frac{56}{b+7} 也必须是一个整数。这意味着 (b+7) 必须是 56 的一个因数。\n56 的所有正因数是：1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 56。\n根据题意，底数 b 必须满足条件 b > 9。由此可得 b+7 > 9+7，即 b+7 > 16。\n我们现在在 56 的因数中寻找大于 16 的值，这些值是 28 和 56。所以，b+7 的可能值为 28 或 56。\n\n当 b+7 = 28 时，b = 21。 (满足 b > 9)\n当 b+7 = 56 时，b = 49。 (满足 b > 9)\n\n因此，所有满足条件的整数底数 b 为 21 和 49。这些底数的和为：\n\\Sigma b = 21 + 49 = 70\nI-2. 在 ▲ABC 中，点 A, D, E, B 依次排列在边 AB 上，使得 AD=4, DE=16, EB=8。点 A, F, G, C 依次排列在边 AC 上，使得 AF=13, FG=52, GC=26。已知四边形 DEGF 的面积为 288。设 M 是点 D 关于点 F 的反射点（对称点），N 是点 G 关于点 E 的反射点。求七边形 AFNBCEM 的面积。解：\n好的，我们按照您提供的思路，使用更侧重于比例和几何变换的逻辑来重新组织解题过程。\n\n1. 线段比例分析与平行关系首先，分析边 \\overline{AB} 和 \\overline{AC} 上的线段长度和比例。\n\n边 \\overline{AB}:\n\nAD=4, DE=16, EB=8 \\implies AB = AD+DE+EB = 28.\nAE = AD+DE = 20.\n比例关系: AD:AE:AB = 4:20:28 = 1:5:7.\n\n\n边 \\overline{AC}:\n\nAF=13, FG=52, GC=26 \\implies AC = AF+FG+GC = 91.\nAG = AF+FG = 65.\n比例关系: AF:AG:AC = 13:65:91 = 1:5:7.\n\n\n\n根据以上比例，我们发现：\n\\frac{AD}{AB} = \\frac{AF}{AC} = \\frac{1}{7} \\quad \\text{以及} \\quad \\frac{AE}{AB} = \\frac{AG}{AC} = \\frac{5}{7}根据泰勒斯定理（逆定理），这些比例关系意味着：\nDF \\parallel EG \\parallel BC因此，四边形 DEGF 是一个梯形。\n2. 计算 \\triangle ABC 的面积设 S_{XYZ} 代表 \\triangle XYZ 的面积。由于 \\triangle ADF, \\triangle AEG, \\triangle ABC 共用顶点 A，它们的面积比等于对应边乘积之比。\n\nS_{ADF} = \\frac{AD}{AB} \\cdot \\frac{AF}{AC} \\cdot S_{ABC} = \\frac{1}{7} \\cdot \\frac{1}{7} \\cdot S_{ABC} = \\frac{1}{49} S_{ABC}.\nS_{AEG} = \\frac{AE}{AB} \\cdot \\frac{AG}{AC} \\cdot S_{ABC} = \\frac{5}{7} \\cdot \\frac{5}{7} \\cdot S_{ABC} = \\frac{25}{49} S_{ABC}.\n\n四边形 DEGF 的面积为：\nS_{DEGF} = S_{AEG} - S_{ADF} = (\\frac{25}{49} - \\frac{1}{49}) S_{ABC} = \\frac{24}{49} S_{ABC}已知 S_{DEGF} = 288，可得：\n288 = \\frac{24}{49} S_{ABC} \\implies S_{ABC} = \\frac{288 \\cdot 49}{24} = 12 \\cdot 49 = 588接下来要拆分这个七边形的组成。\n\n由反射（镜像）关系导出的面积相等关系\n\n\nD \\xrightarrow{F} M (D关于F的反射点为M):  这意味着 F 是线段 DM 的中点。  对于 \\triangle ADM 和 \\triangle AMF，它们若以线段所在的直线 AC 为底边，则它们的顶点 D 和 M 到直线 AC 的距离（高）相等。因此：\nS_{AMF} = S_{ADF}\nG \\xrightarrow{E} N (G关于E的反射点为N):  这意味着 E 是线段 GN 的中点。  对于 \\triangle EBG 和 \\triangle EBN，它们共享底边 EB。它们的顶点 G 和 N 到直线 AB 的距离（高）相等。因此：\nS_{EBN} = S_{EBG}\n四边形面积关系:  考虑四边形 FMEN 和 DEGF。  S_{FMEN} = S_{FME} + S_{FNE}.  在 \\triangle DME 中，因 F 是 DM 中点，所以 FE 是中线 \\implies S_{FME} = S_{FDE}。  在 \\triangle GNE 中，因 E 是 GN 中点，所以 FE 是中线 \\implies S_{FNE} = S_{FGE}。  因此，S_{FMEN} = S_{FDE} + S_{FGE} = S_{DEGF}.\n\n\n4. 七边形面积分解与求和我们将七边形 AFNBCEM 的总面积视为由四个不重叠的区域构成：\\triangle AFM, 四边形 FMEN, \\triangle EBN, 和 \\triangle BCE。\nS_{AFNBCEM} = S_{AFM} + S_{FMEN} + S_{EBN} + S_{BCE}现在，我们将每个区域的面积表示为 S_{ABC} 的分数：\n\nS_{AFM} = S_{ADF} = \\frac{1}{49}S_{ABC}.\n\nS_{FMEN} = S_{DEGF} = \\frac{24}{49}S_{ABC}.\n\nS_{EBN} = S_{EBG} = S_{ABG} - S_{AEG}.S_{ABG} 和 S_{ABC} 共用高（从B到AC），面积比等于底之比：S_{ABG} = \\frac{AG}{AC} S_{ABC} = \\frac{5}{7} S_{ABC}。S_{EBN} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7} - \\frac{25}{49}\\right) S_{ABC} = \\left(\\frac{35}{49} - \\frac{25}{49}\\right) S_{ABC} = \\frac{10}{49}S_{ABC}.\n\nS_{BCE} 和 S_{ABC} 共用高（从C到AB），面积比等于底之比：S_{BCE} = \\frac{BE}{AB} S_{ABC} = \\frac{8}{28} S_{ABC} = \\frac{2}{7} S_{ABC} = \\frac{14}{49}S_{ABC}.\n\n\n最后，将所有部分相加：\nS_{AFNBCEM} = \\left( \\frac{1}{49} + \\frac{24}{49} + \\frac{10}{49} + \\frac{14}{49} \\right) S_{ABC}S_{AFNBCEM} = \\left( \\frac{1 + 24 + 10 + 14}{49} \\right) S_{ABC} = \\frac{49}{49} S_{ABC} = S_{ABC}5. 结论七边形 AFNBCEM 的面积等于 \\triangle ABC 的面积。\nS_{AFNBCEM} = S_{ABC} = 588\nPython

\\cdot 3! \\cdot 2!} = \\frac{9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5}{3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = 1260\n\n4. 计算总方案数 N总方案数 N 是所有可能情况下的方案数之和。\nN = N_1 + N_2 + N_3 = 252 + 504 + 1260 = 20165. 求 N 除以 1000 的余数最后，我们计算 N 对 1000 取模。\nN \\pmod{1000} = 2016 \\pmod{1000}2016 = 2 \\times 1000 + 16所以，余数是 16。\n6. 答案: N 除以 1000 的余数是 16。\n\nI-4.求有序整数对 (x,y) 的数量，其中 x 和 y 均为 [-100, 100] 范围内的整数，且满足方程 12x^2-xy-6y^2=0。\n解:\n1. 因式分解方程给定的方程是一个关于 x 和 y 的二次齐次方程。我们可以将其因式分解。把该方程看作是关于 x 的一元二次方程，我们可以尝试分解二次项 12x^2 和常数项 -6y^2。\n12x^{2}-xy-6y^{2}=0我们可以将它分解为两个线性因子的乘积：\n(4x - 3y)(3x + 2y) = 0验证:\n(4x)(3x) + (4x)(2y) + (-3y)(3x) + (-3y)(2y) = 12x^2 + 8xy - 9xy - 6y^2 = 12x^2 - xy - 6y^2分解正确。\n2. 导出线性关系为了使两个因子的乘积为零，其中至少一个因子必须为零。这给了我们两种可能的情况：\n\n情况一: 4x - 3y = 0 \\implies 4x = 3y\n情况二: 3x + 2y = 0 \\implies 3x = -2y\n\n我们需要分别计算在这两种情况下，满足整数和范围约束的 (x,y) 对的数量。\n3. 分析情况一: 4x = 3y为了使整数 x 和 y 满足此方程， x 必须是 3 的倍数，同时 y 必须是 4 的倍数。我们可以引入一个整数参数 k 来表示所有的整数解：令 x = 3k, 则 y = 4k。因此，所有解的形式为 (3k, 4k)。\n现在，我们将范围约束应用于 x 和 y：\n\n-100 \\le x \\le 100 \\implies -100 \\le 3k \\le 100 \\implies -\\frac{100}{3} \\le k \\le \\frac{100}{3} \\implies -33.33... \\le k \\le 33.33...\n-100 \\le y \\le 100 \\implies -100 \\le 4k \\le 100 \\implies -\\frac{100}{4} \\le k \\le \\frac{100}{4} \\implies -25 \\le k \\le 25\n\n整数 k 必须同时满足这两个条件，因此我们取两个范围的交集，即更严格的那个范围：\n-25 \\le k \\le 25因此，k 的可能取值为 -25, -24, \\dots, 0, \\dots, 24, 25\n整数 k 的数量为: \n25 - (-25) + 1 = 51所以，在情况一中有 51 个满足条件的有序对。\n4. 分析情况二: 3x = -2y同样，为了使整数 x 和 y 满足此方程， x 必须是 2 的倍数， y 必须是 3 的倍数。我们引入另一个整数参数 m：令 x = 2m, 则 y = -3m。所有解的形式为 (2m, -3m)。\n应用范围约束：\n\n-100 \\le x \\le 100 \\implies -100 \\le 2m \\le 100 \\implies -50 \\le m \\le 50\n-100 \\le y \\le 100 \\implies -100 \\le -3m \\le 100 \\implies \\frac{100}{3} \\ge m \\ge -\\frac{100}{3} \\implies -33.33... \\le m \\le 33.33...\n\n整数 m 必须同时满足这两个条件，我们取其交集：\n-33 \\le m \\le 33因此，m 的可能取值为 -33, -32, \\dots, 0, \\dots, 32, 33整数 m 的数量为: 33 - (-33) + 1 = 67所以，在情况二中有 67 个满足条件的有序对。\n5. 处理重叠解并计算总量两种情况的解集都包含了一个共同的解。当 k=0 时，情况一的解为 (0,0)。当 m=0 时，情况二的解也为 (0,0)。这是唯一重叠的解。\n根据容斥原理，总的有序对数量为两种情况的数量之和减去重叠部分的数量。\n\\text{总数量} = (\\text{情况一的数量}) + (\\text{情况二的数量}) - (\\text{重叠数量})\\text{总数量} = 51 + 67 - 1 = 1176. 答案:满足条件的有序整数对 (x,y) 的数量是 117。\n\nI-5. 使用数字 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 各一次可以组成 8! = 40320 个不同的八位正整数。设 N 是这些整数中能被 22 整除的个数。求 N 与 2025 的差。\n解:\n1. 分析整除条件一个数能被 22 整除，当且仅当它同时能被 2 和 11 整除。\n\n被 2 整除: 该数的末位数字必须是偶数。在给定的数字集合 \\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\\} 中，偶数有 \\{2,4,6,8\\}。\n被 11 整除: 该数的奇数位数字之和与偶数位数字之和的差是 11 的倍数。\n\n设八位数为 d_1d_2d_3d_4d_5d_6d_7d_8。令奇数位数字的集合为 A = \\{d_1, d_3, d_5, d_7\\}，其元素之和为 S_A。令偶数位数字的集合为 B = \\{d_2, d_4, d_6, d_8\\}，其元素之和为 S_B。\n根据被 11 整除的规则，S_A - S_B 必须是 11 的倍数。\n2. 求解数字分组所有八个数字的总和为：\n1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8 = \\frac{8 \\times 9}{2} = 36我们有以下方程组：\n\\begin{cases} S_A + S_B = 36 \\\\ S_A - S_B = 11k \\quad (\\text{其中 } k \\text{ 为整数}) \\end{cases}两式相加得到 2S_A = 36 + 11k。由于 S_A 是整数，所以 36+11k 必须是偶数，这意味着 11k 必须是偶数，因此 k 必须是偶数。\n以及，S_A 是从集合 \\{1, ..., 8\\} 中选取 4 个不同数字的和，它的取值范围是：\n\n最小和: 1+2+3+4 = 10\n最大和: 5+6+7+8 = 26\n\n代入 S_A = 18 + 5.5k，我们测试偶数 k 的值：\n\n若 k=0, 则 S_A = 18。这在 [10, 26] 范围内，可行。\n若 k=2, 则 S_A = 18 + 11 = 29，超出范围。\n若 k=-2, 则 S_A = 18 - 11 = 7，超出范围。\n\n因此，唯一可能的解是 k=0，这意味着 S_A - S_B = 0，即 S_A = S_B = 18。\n问题转化为：从集合 \\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\\} 中选出 4 个数字，使其和为 18。这些数字将构成奇数位数字的集合 A。\n满足条件的集合 A 共有 8 组：1.\\{1, 2, 7, 8\\}2.\\{1, 3, 6, 8\\}3.\\{1, 4, 5, 8\\}4.\\{2, 3, 5, 8\\}5.\\{1, 4, 6, 7\\}6.\\{2, 3, 6, 7\\}7.\\{2, 4, 5, 7\\}8.\\{3, 4, 5, 6\\}\n一旦集合 A 确定，集合 B（偶数位数字）也随之确定。\n3. 结合被 2 整除的条件数字的末位 d_8 必须是偶数。由于 d_8 处于偶数位，它的值必须来自集合 B。一个关键的观察是：对于上述任意一个和为 18 的集合 A，它都包含 2 个奇数和 2 个偶数。\n\n证明：集合中奇数的和必为偶数，才能使总和为偶数（18）。4个奇数的和是奇数+奇数+奇数+奇数=偶数，2个奇数的和是偶数，0个奇数的和是偶数。经检验，所有8组解都含有2个奇数和2个偶数。\n推论：因为总共有4个奇数和4个偶数，所以如果集合 A 有2个奇数和2个偶数，那么其补集 B 也必定有2个奇数和2个偶数。\n\n因此，对于任意一种分组方式，偶数位上的数字集合 B 中都恰好有两个偶数。\n4. 计算总数 N我们来计算对于一种特定的分组，例如 A=\\{1,2,7,8\\} 和 B=\\{3,4,5,6\\}，有多少种排列方式。\n\n确定末位 d_8: d_8 必须是集合 B 中的偶数，即 4 或 6。有 2 种选择。\n排列偶数位: 剩下的 3 个偶数位 (d_2, d_4, d_6) 可以由集合 B 中剩余的 3 个数字任意排列。有 3! 种方式。\n排列奇数位: 4 个奇数位 (d_1, d_3, d_5, d_7) 可以由集合 A 中的 4 个数字任意排列。有 4! 种方式。\n\n所以，对于每一种分组，满足条件的排列数为：\n2 \\times 3! \\times 4! = 2 \\times 6 \\times 24 = 288我们总共有 8 种不同的方式来选择集合 A（即 8 种分组方式），所以总数 N 为：\nN = 8 \\times 288 = 23045. 计算最终结果题目要求计算 N 与 2025 的差。\nN - 2025 = 2304 - 2025 = 2796. 答案:N 与 2025 的差是 279。\n\nI-6. 一个等腰梯形有一个内切圆，该圆与梯形的四条边都相切。圆的半径为3，梯形的面积为72。设梯形的两个平行边长分别为 r 和 s，且 r != s。求 r^2+s^2 的值。\n解:\n1. 利用面积和半径求高与底之和对于一个有内切圆的梯形，它的高 h 等于内切圆的直径。已知半径 R=3，则：\nh = 2R = 2 \\times 3 = 6梯形的面积公式为：\n\\text{面积} = \\frac{(r+s)}{2} \\times h我们将已知值代入公式：\n72 = \\frac{(r+s)}{2} \\times 672 = 3(r+s)r+s = \\frac{72}{3} = 242. 利用内切性质求斜边根据皮托管定理（Pitot’s Theorem），一个拥有内切圆的四边形，其对边和相等。对于等腰梯形，设其不平行的斜边长为 c，则：\nr+s = c+c = 2c将上一部分的结果代入，我们得到：\n24 = 2cc = 123. 利用勾股定理求底之差我们可以从梯形较短的底的两个端点向较长的底作高，从而得到两个全等的直角三角形。\n\n直角三角形的高为梯形的高 h=6。\n直角三角形的斜边为梯形的斜边 c=12。\n直角三角形的底边长为 \\frac{s-r}{2}（假设 s>r）。\n\n根据勾股定理：\nh^2 + \\left(\\frac{s-r}{2}\\right)^2 = c^26^2 + \\left(\\frac{s-r}{2}\\right)^2 = 12^236 + \\left(\\frac{s-r}{2}\\right)^2 = 144\\left(\\frac{s-r}{2}\\right)^2 = 108\\frac{s-r}{2} = \\sqrt{108} = \\sqrt{36 \\times 3} = 6\\sqrt{3}s-r = 12\\sqrt{3}4. 求解 r^2 + s^2我们现在拥有一个关于 r 和 s 的方程组：\n\\begin{cases} r+s = 24 \\\\ s-r = 12\\sqrt{3} \\end{cases}为了求解 r^2+s^2，我们可以利用以下恒等式：\n(r+s)^2 + (s-r)^2 = 2(r^2+s^2)代入我们求得的值：\n24^2 + (12\\sqrt{3})^2 = 2(r^2+s^2)576 + (144 \\times 3) = 2(r^2+s^2)576 + 432 = 2(r^2+s^2)1008 = 2(r^2+s^2)r^2+s^2 = \\frac{1008}{2} = 5045. 答案所以，r^2+s^2 的值是 504。\nPython 代码生成几何图形\n您可以使用下面的 Python 代码（需要 matplotlib 和 numpy 库）来可视化这个问题中的图形。\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport numpy as npfrom matplotlib.patches import Polygon, Circledef plot_trapezoid():    &quot;&quot;&quot;    This function generates a plot of the isosceles trapezoid    with its inscribed circle and labeled dimensions.    &quot;&quot;&quot;    # --- 1.

4 = 0a^2 - b^2 + 2abi - 4 = 0(a^2 - b^2 - 4) + 2abi = 0这要求：\na^2 - b^2 - 4 = 0 \\quad \\text{且} \\quad 2ab = 0从 $2ab = 0$ 得 $a = 0$ 或 $b = 0$。\n当 $a = 0$ 时：\n-b^2 - 4 = 0b^2 = -4b = \\pm 2i但 $b$ 必须是实数，矛盾。\n当 $b = 0$ 时：\na^2 - 4 = 0a = \\pm 2所以 $k = 2$ 或 $k = -2$。\n5. 答案满足条件的复数 k 为 $k = 2$ 和 $k = -2$。\n\nI-9. 在平面直角坐标系中，抛物线 y = x² 绕原点逆时针旋转 45° 后的方程为 xy = 1/2。求旋转后抛物线上到原点距离最小的点的坐标。解:\n1. 验证旋转后的方程原抛物线：$y = x^2$\n逆时针旋转 45° 的变换矩阵：\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos 45° & -\\sin 45° \\\\ \\sin 45° & \\cos 45° \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} & -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\\\ \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} & \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\end{pmatrix}2. 求旋转后抛物线上到原点距离最小的点旋转后的方程为 $xy = \\frac{1}{2}$，即 $y = \\frac{1}{2x}$。\n点到原点的距离平方为：\nd^2 = x^2 + y^2 = x^2 + \\frac{1}{4x^2}3. 使用拉格朗日乘数法要最小化 $f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2$，约束条件为 $g(x, y) = xy -

V^\\pi(s)\n如果 A > 0, 说明动作 a 比平均水平要好。\n如果 A < 0, 说明动作 a 比平均水平要差。\n\n 优势函数是 PPO 算法中的一个核心概念，它告诉我们策略更新应该朝哪个方向进行。\n\n\n从 Q-Learning 到 Policy Gradient传统的 Q-Learning 是一种基于价值的方法。它通过学习一个最优的动作价值函数 Q^*(s, a) 来间接得到最优策略。其策略通常是贪婪的：在状态 s 下，选择使 Q(s, a) 值最大的动作 a。这种方法在处理连续动作空间或需要随机策略时会遇到困难。\n为了解决这些问题，策略梯度 (Policy Gradient, PG) 方法应运而生。PG 不再学习价值函数，而是直接对策略 \\pi_\\theta(a|s) 进行参数化（\\theta 是神经网络的参数），然后通过梯度上升来优化策略，以最大化期望总回报 \\mathcal{J}(\\theta)。\nPG 的核心思想很简单：如果一个动作带来了好的结果（即高的优势值），我们就增加这个动作被选择的概率；反之，则减少。\n然而，朴素的 PG 算法存在一些问题：\n\n高方差：梯度的估计可能非常不稳定，导致训练过程震荡。\n更新步长难以确定：如果更新步长（学习率）太大，可能会导致策略“崩溃”，即更新后的策略表现急剧下降，且难以恢复。如果步长太小，则训练速度过慢。\n\nPPO 是什么？近端策略优化 (Proximal Policy Optimization, PPO) 是一种旨在解决策略梯度方法中更新步长问题的算法。它是对 信赖域策略优化 (Trust Region Policy Optimization, TRPO) 的一种简化，在实现上更简单，但效果同样出色。\nPPO 流程示意图下面是一个简化的 PPO 工作流程图：\ngraph TD    A[Actor: π_θ_old] -- &quot;与环境交互&quot; --&gt; B(收集轨迹 τ);    B -- &quot;计算每个时间步的优势 A_t&quot; --&gt; C;    C[Critic: V_φ] -- &quot;计算V(s_t)辅助计算A_t&quot; --&gt; B;    B -- &quot;将(s_t, a_t, A_t)存入缓冲区&quot; --&gt; D(经验缓冲区);    D -- &quot;重复K个Epoch&quot; --&gt; E&#123;优化循环&#125;;    E -- &quot;采样一个Minibatch&quot; --&gt; F(计算PPO目标函数 L_CLIP);    F -- &quot;计算梯度 ∇_θ L_CLIP&quot; --&gt; G(更新Actor网络参数 θ);    E -- &quot;采样一个Minibatch&quot; --&gt; H(计算价值损失 L_VF);    H -- &quot;计算梯度 ∇_φ L_VF&quot; --&gt; I(更新Critic网络参数 φ);    G &amp; I -- &quot;K个Epoch结束后&quot; --&gt; J[新策略 π_θ];    J -- &quot;π_θ_old ← π_θ&quot; --&gt; A;\nPPO 的核心思想PPO 的核心思想是：在尝试最大化目标函数的同时，使用一个“惩罚”项来限制新旧策略之间的差异，确保每次更新不会让策略变得太离谱。\n想象一下你在一个山坡上试图走到山顶（最大化奖励）。朴素的 PG 方法就像是你蒙着眼睛朝你认为最陡峭的方向迈出一大步，但你可能会不小心滚下悬崖（策略崩溃）。PPO 则是在你脚上绑了一根绳子，绳子的另一端固定在你之前的位置。你可以自由地向任何方向迈步，但如果步子迈得太大，绳子就会把你拉回来，防止你摔得太远。\n这个“绳子”就是 PPO 中的 Clipping (裁剪) 机制。\nPPO 的目标函数 (Objective Function)PPO 的目标函数是其精髓所在，我们先来看最常用的 PPO-Clip 的目标函数：\n\\mathcal{L}^{CLIP}(\\theta) = \\hat{\\mathbb{E}}_t \\left[ \\min\\left( r_t(\\theta) \\hat{A}_t, \\text{clip}(r_t(\\theta), 1 - \\epsilon, 1 + \\epsilon) \\hat{A}_t \\right) \\right]r_t(\\theta) = \\frac{\\pi_\\theta(a_t | s_t)}{\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(a_t | s_t)}让我们来拆解这个复杂的公式：\n\n\\hat{\\mathbb{E}}_t[...]: 表示对一个批次（batch）中所有时间步 t 的样本取平均。\nr_t(\\theta): 这是新旧策略之间的概率比率 (probability ratio)。\n\\pi_\\theta(a_t | s_t): 当前正在优化的新策略。\n\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(a_t | s_t): 用于收集数据的旧策略。\n如果 r_t(\\theta) > 1, 说明新策略更倾向于采取动作 a_t。\n如果 r_t(\\theta) < 1, 说明新策略不太倾向于采取动作 a_t。\n\n\n\\hat{A}_t: 这是在时间步 t 的优势函数 Advantage 的估计值。\n\\text{clip}(r_t(\\theta), 1 - \\epsilon, 1 + \\epsilon) : 这个函数将概率比率 r_t(\\theta) 裁剪到一个范围 [1 - \\epsilon, 1 + \\epsilon] 内。\\epsilon 是一个超参数，通常取 0.1 或 0.2。\n\\min(...): PPO 的关键部分。它在两个项之间取最小值。\n\nPPO 算法详解Clipped Surrogate Objective Function我们来详细分析 \\min 函数中的两项：\n\nr_t(\\theta) \\hat{A}_t: 这是标准的策略梯度目标函数。如果优势 \\hat{A}_t 是正的，我们会想要增大 r_t(\\theta)（即增加 \\pi_\\theta(a_t|s_t)），从而最大化这一项。如果 \\hat{A}_t 是负的，我们会想要减小 r_t(\\theta)。\n\n\\text{clip}(r_t(\\theta), 1 - \\epsilon, 1 + \\epsilon) \\hat{A}_t: 这是被裁剪过的版本，是 PPO 的创新之处。\n\n\n为什么要取 \\min？\n这是一种悲观主义的或者说保守的更新方式。\n\n当 \\hat{A}_t > 0 (好动作) 时:\n\\mathcal{L}^{CLIP} = \\hat{\\mathbb{E}}_t \\left[ \\min(r_t(\\theta), 1 + \\epsilon) \\hat{A}_t \\right]这意味着，我们希望增加好动作的概率 (r_t(\\theta) 变大)，但是这个增加是有限度的。r_t(\\theta) 最多只能增长到 1+\\epsilon。这防止了策略因为一个特别好的动作而过度更新，导致在其他状态下表现变差。\n\n当 \\hat{A}_t < 0 (坏动作) 时:\n\\mathcal{L}^{CLIP} = \\hat{\\mathbb{E}}_t \\left[ \\max(r_t(\\theta), 1 - \\epsilon) \\hat{A}_t \\right](注意，因为 \\hat{A}_t 是负数，\\min 实际上变成了 \\max）。这意味着，我们希望减小坏动作的概率 (r_t(\\theta) 变小)，但这个减小也是有限度的。r_t(\\theta) 最少只能减小到 1-\\epsilon。这防止了策略因为一个坏动作而过度惩罚，导致策略完全放弃探索某些可能在未来有价值的动作。\n\n\n通过这种方式，PPO 将策略更新限制在了一个“信赖域”内，使得训练过程更加稳定。\n价值函数损失 (Value Function Loss)在 PPO 这种 Actor-Critic 架构中，除了负责决策的 Actor (策略网络)，还有一个负责“评价”的 Critic (价值网络)。Critic 的作用是学习状态价值函数 V(s)，即评估处于某个状态 s 下有多好。这个评估值对于计算优势函数 \\hat{A}_t 至关重要，因为 \\hat{A}_t 直接指导了 Actor 的更新方向。\n价值函数损失就是专门用来训练 Critic 网络的损失函数。它的目标是让 Critic 对状态价值的预测 V_\\phi(s_t) (其中 \\phi 是价值网络的参数) 尽可能地接近“真实”的价值。\n1. 公式定义\n价值函数损失通常是一个简单的均方误差 (Mean Squared Error, MSE)：\n\\mathcal{L}^{VF}(\\phi) = \\hat{\\mathbb{E}}_t \\left[ (V_\\phi(s_t) - V_t^{\\text{target}})^2 \\right]让我们来解析这个公式：\n\n\\hat{\\mathbb{E}}_t[\\dots]: 表示对一个批次（batch）中所有时间步 t 的样本取平均。\nV_\\phi(s_t): 这是 Critic 网络对状态 s_t 的预测价值。\nV_t^{\\text{target}}: 这是我们在该时间步观测到的“目标价值”或“真实价值”。它是一个我们希望 Critic 网络输出的目标。\n\n2. 目标价值 V_t^{\\text{target}} 是什么？\n既然 V(s) 本身就是对未来总回报的期望，那么最直接的“真实价值”就是我们在该轮游戏中，从状态 s_t 开始实际获得的累积回报（也称为 Monte Carlo Return）。\n在实际操作中，V_t^{\\text{target}} 通常就是我们计算 GAE (Generalized Advantage Estimation) 时用到的回报估计值。简单来说，它可以是：\nV_t^{\\text{target}} = \\hat{A}_t + V_\\phi(s_t)这个公式看起来可能有点循环引用，但在计算时，V_\\phi(s_t) 是从旧的网络中得到的值（value.detach()），而 \\hat{A}_t 是已经基于这批数据计算好的优势估计。所以，我们实际上是让新的价值网络去拟合一个更精确的、结合了实际奖励和旧价值估计的目标。\n3. 为什么需要这个损失项？\n训练 Critic 的目的就是为了给 Actor 提供一个准确的优势函数估计 \\hat{A}_t。\n\n一个准确的 Critic 能够提供低方差的优势估计，这使得 Actor 的更新更加稳定和高效。如果 Critic 对价值的评估是胡乱猜测的，那么计算出的优势信号也会充满噪声，误导 Actor 的学习方向。\n通过最小化 \\mathcal{L}^{VF}，我们不断地用实际观测到的回报来校准 Critic 的判断力，让它成为一个越来越可靠的“评论家”。\n\n4. 在 PPO 中的作用\n在 PPO 的整体优化目标中，价值损失 \\mathcal{L}^{VF} 是作为辅助损失项存在的。它与 Actor 的策略损失 \\mathcal{L}^{CLIP} 结合在一起，形成一个总的损失函数：\n\\mathcal{L}(\\theta, \\phi) = \\mathcal{L}^{CLIP}(\\theta) - c_1 \\mathcal{L}^{VF}(\\phi) + c_2 S[\\pi_\\theta](s_t)其中 c_1 是价值损失的系数，用于平衡策略学习和价值学习的重要性。这两个网络通常会一起训练，但它们的目标不同：Actor (参数 \\theta) 负责最大化 \\mathcal{L}^{CLIP}，而 Critic (参数 \\phi) 负责最小化 \\mathcal{L}^{VF}。\n多轮次更新 (Multiple Epochs of Minibatch Updates)PPO 的另一个重要特点是它可以在同一批数据上进行多次（K个Epoch）的梯度更新。这大大提高了样本的利用效率。传统的 A2C (Advantage Actor-Critic) 算法每收集一批数据只能更新一次网络，而 PPO 可以用这批数据训练好几个 Epoch，只要策略更新不偏离旧策略太远（由 Clip 机制保证）。\nPPO 算法流程下面是 PPO 算法更具体的伪代码：\n\n初始化: 初始化 Actor 网络 \\pi_\\theta 和 Critic 网络 V_\\phi 的参数 \\theta, \\phi。\n循环 (for iteration = 1, 2, …):a.  数据收集: 使用当前策略 \\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}} \\leftarrow \\pi_\\theta，与环境交互 N 个时间步，收集一批轨迹 \\mathcal{D} = \\{\\tau_i\\}。b.  优势计算: 对收集到的每个时间步 t，计算优势函数 \\hat{A}_t。通常使用 GAE (Generalized Advantage Estimation) 方法来平衡偏差和方差。\n\\hat{A}_t = \\delta_t + (\\gamma\\lambda)\\delta_{t+1} + ... + (\\gamma\\lambda)^{T-t+1}\\delta_{T-1}其中 \\delta_t = r_t + \\gamma V(s_{t+1}) - V(s_t)c.  优化循环 (for epoch = 1, 2, …, K):\n\n从 \\mathcal{D} 中随机采样一个小批量（Minibatch）数据。\n计算 Actor 的损失 \\mathcal{L}^{CLIP}(\\theta)。\n计算 Critic 的损失 \\mathcal{L}^{VF}(\\phi) = ||(V_\\phi(s_t) - V_t^{\\text{target}}||^2_2 (均方误差)。V_t^{\\text{target}} 通常是 \\hat{A}_t + V_\\phi(s_t)。\n（可选）计算熵损失 S[\\pi_\\theta](s_t)，鼓励探索。\n更新 Actor 和 Critic 的网络参数：\n\n\\theta \\leftarrow \\theta - \\alpha_\\theta \\nabla_\\theta (\\mathcal{L}^{CLIP} - c_1 \\mathcal{L}^{VF} + c_2 S)\\phi \\leftarrow \\phi - \\alpha_\\phi \\nabla_\\phi \\mathcal{L}^{VF}\n结束\n\n实例：用 PPO 玩石头剪刀布让我们看一个简单的例子：训练一个 AI 来玩石头剪刀布。\n环境设定\n对手: 不是完全随机的，而是一个有特定偏好的对手。比如，他出“石头”的概率是 50%，出“剪刀”和“布”的概率各是 25%。\n状态 (State): 为了简单起见，我们可以将状态设为对手上一次出的手势。如果游戏是独立的，状态也可以是一个常数。\n动作 (Action): 我们的 AI 可以选择出“石头”(0)、“剪刀”(1) 或“布”(2)。\n奖励 (Reward):\n赢: +1\n平: 0\n输: -1\n\n\n\n模型设计\nActor: 一个简单的神经网络。输入是状态（对手上一次的手势，独热编码），输出是三个动作（石头、剪刀、布）的概率分布（通过 Softmax 层）。\nCritic: 另一个简单的神经网络。输入是状态，输出是一个标量，代表当前状态的价值 V(s)。\n\n训练过程\n初始化: 随机初始化 Actor 和 Critic 网络的权重。我们的 AI 一开始是胡乱出拳的。\n收集数据: 让我们的 AI (Actor) 和有偏好的对手玩，比如玩 100 局。记录下每一局的状态、我们出的动作、以及获得的回报。例如，记录 (s_t= 对手出石头 , a_t= 我出剪刀, r_t= -1)。\n计算优势:\n用 Critic 网络预测每一局开始时的状态价值 V(s_t)。\n因为石头剪刀布是单步游戏，优势函数可以简化为 A_t = r_t - V(s_t)。\n例如，在 s_t（对手上把出石头）时，我们出了“布”赢了 (r_t=1)。假设 Critic 预测 V(s_t)=0.1。那么优势 A_t = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9。这是一个很大的正优势。\n\n\nPPO 更新:\n我们使用收集到的 100 局数据，进行多轮（比如 K=4）优化。\n在每一轮中，我们计算 PPO 的 \\mathcal&#123;L&#125;CLIP 损失。\n对于刚才那个例子，因为 A_t=0.9 是正的，算法会尝试提高在 s_t 状态下出“布”的概率。\nclip 机制会确保这个概率的提升不会太大，比如 r_t 不会超过 1.2。\n同时，我们也更新 Critic 网络，让它的预测 V(s_t) 更接近实际获得的回报 r_t。\n\n\n重复: 不断地重复步骤 2-4。\n\n结果经过多轮训练后：\n\nActor 会学到，当对手有 50% 的概率出“石头”时，我应该提高出“布”的概率，这样胜率最高。它的策略会逐渐收敛到一个最优解（高概率出布）。\nCritic 会学到，在面对这个对手时，游戏的初始状态价值是正的，因为我们有优势。\n\n这个例子展示了 PPO 如何通过与环境交互，稳定地学习到一个能利用环境特性（对手偏好）的策略。\n\n附录：数学推导这里提供了一些核心概念的数学推导，以供深入理解。\n[策略梯度定理推导]策略梯度定理是策略梯度方法的基础，它表明了目标函数 \\mathcal{J}(\\theta) 的梯度可以被写成一个期望的形式，从而可以用蒙特卡洛采样来估计。我们的目标是找到能最大化期望总回报 \\mathcal{J}(\\theta) 的策略参数 \\theta。\n1. 目标函数定义\n首先，我们定义目标函数 \\mathcal{J}(\\theta) 为遵循策略 \\pi_\\theta 时，所有可能轨迹 \\tau 的期望总回报。\n\\mathcal{J}(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\tau \\sim \\pi_\\theta} [R(\\tau)] = \\sum_{\\tau} P(\\tau|\\theta) R(\\tau)其中，R(\\tau) = \\sum_{t=0}^{T} r(s_t, a_t) 是轨迹 \\tau 的总回报，P(\\tau|\\theta) 是在参数为 \\theta 的策略下，轨迹 \\tau 发生的概率。\n2. 求目标函数的梯度\n我们对目标函数求关于 \\theta 的梯度：\n\\nabla_\\theta \\mathcal{J}(\\theta) = \\nabla_\\theta \\sum_{\\tau} P(\\tau|\\theta) R(\\tau) = \\sum_{\\tau} \\nabla_\\theta P(\\tau|\\theta) R(\\tau)3. 应用对数导数技巧 (Log-Derivative Trick)\n直接计算 \\nabla_\\theta P(\\tau|\\theta) 很困难。这里我们使用一个关键技巧：\\nabla_x f(x) = f(x) \\nabla_x \\log f(x)。将其应用到 P(\\tau|\\theta) 上：\n\\nabla_\\theta P(\\tau|\\theta) = P(\\tau|\\theta) \\nabla_\\theta \\log P(\\tau|\\theta)将这个技巧代入梯度公式中：\n\\nabla_\\theta \\mathcal{J}(\\theta) = \\sum_{\\tau} P(\\tau|\\theta) \\nabla_\\theta \\log P(\\tau|\\theta) R(\\tau)这个形式正好是某个期望值的定义，所以可以写成：\n\\nabla_\\theta \\mathcal{J}(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\tau \\sim \\pi_\\theta} [\\nabla_\\theta \\log P(\\tau|\\theta) R(\\tau)]4. 展开轨迹概率\n现在我们来处理 \\log P(\\tau|\\theta)。一条轨迹的概率是初始状态概率和一系列动作概率与状态转移概率的乘积：\nP(\\tau|\\theta) = p(s_0) \\prod_{t=0}^{T} \\pi_\\theta(a_t|s_t) p(s_{t+1}|s_t, a_t)对其取对数：\n\\log P(\\tau|\\theta) = \\log p(s_0) + \\sum_{t=0}^{T} \\left( \\log \\pi_\\theta(a_t|s_t) + \\log p(s_{t+1}|s_t, a_t) \\right)再对其求关于 \\theta 的梯度。注意到，环境的状态转移概率 p(s_{t+1}|s_t, a_t) 和初始状态概率 p(s_0) 都与策略参数 \\theta 无关，所以它们的梯度为零。因此：\n\\nabla_\\theta \\log P(\\tau|\\theta) = \\sum_{t=0}^{T} \\nabla_\\theta \\log \\pi_\\theta(a_t|s_t)5. 得到策略梯度的基本形式\n将上式代入第3步的期望公式中，我们得到：\n\\nabla_\\theta \\mathcal{J}(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\tau \\sim \\pi_\\theta} \\left[ \\left( \\sum_{t=0}^{T} \\nabla_\\theta \\log \\pi_\\theta(a_t|s_t) \\right) \\left( \\sum_{t=0}^{T} r(s_t, a_t) \\right) \\right]这个公式虽然正确，但方差很大，因为括号里的回报项 R(\\tau) 会同时乘以过去和未来的所有动作的梯度。\n6. 利用因果关系并引入基线以减小方差\n一个重要的观察是：在时间步 t 的决策 \\pi_\\theta(a_t|s_t) 只会影响从 t 时刻开始的未来回报，而不会影响过去已经获得的回报。因此，我们可以将回报项替换为从当前时刻开始的未来回报总和 G_t = \\sum_{t'=t}^{T} r(s_{t'}, a_{t'})：\n\\nabla_\\theta \\mathcal{J}(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\tau \\sim \\pi_\\theta} \\left[ \\sum_{t=0}^{T} \\nabla_\\theta \\log \\pi_\\theta(a_t|s_t) G_t \\right]为了进一步减小方差，我们可以从回报中减去一个不依赖于动作 a_t 的基线（baseline）b(s_t)。最常用的基线是状态价值函数 V(s_t)。减去基线不会改变梯度的期望值（因为 \\mathbb{E}[\\nabla_\\theta \\log \\pi_\\theta(a_t|s_t) b(s_t)] = 0），但可以显著减小梯度的方差。\n\\nabla_\\theta \\mathcal{J}(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\tau \\sim \\pi_\\theta} \\left[ \\sum_{t=0}^{T} \\nabla_\\theta \\log \\pi_\\theta(a_t|s_t) (G_t - V(s_t)) \\right]7. 最终形式：优势函数\n我们发现，G_t - V(s_t) 正是优势函数 A(s_t, a_t) 的一个估计。因此，策略梯度定理最终可以写成我们熟悉的形式：\n\\nabla_\\theta \\mathcal{J}(\\theta) \\approx \\hat{\\mathbb{E}}_t \\left[ \\nabla_\\theta \\log \\pi_\\theta(a_t|s_t) \\hat{A}_t \\right]这个形式直观地告诉我们：如果一个动作的优势 \\hat{A}_t 是正的，我们就调整参数 \\theta 来增加这个动作的对数概率 \\log \\pi_\\theta(a_t|s_t)；反之亦然。这就是策略梯度方法的核心。\n[信赖域方法推导]TRPO (PPO 的前身) 的目标函数可以写成：\n\\max_\\theta \\quad \\mathbb{E}_{\\substack{s \\sim \\rho^{\\pi_{\\theta_{old}}}， a \\sim \\pi_{\\theta_{old}}}} \\left[ \\frac{\\pi_\\theta(a|s)}{\\pi_{\\theta_{old}}(a|s)} A^{\\pi_{\\theta_{old}}}(s,a) \\right]\\text{s.t.} \\quad \\mathbb{E}_{s \\sim \\rho^{\\pi_{\\theta_{old}}}} \\left[ D_{KL}(\\pi_{\\theta_{old}}(\\cdot|s) || \\pi_\\theta(\\cdot|s)) \\right] \\leq \\delta这里的 D_{KL} 是 KL 散度，用来衡量新旧策略的差异。这个约束确保了策略更新不会偏离旧策略太远，从而保证了训练的稳定性。然而，求解这个带约束的优化问题非常复杂，需要计算二阶导数（Hessian矩阵）。\nPPO 通过 clip 函数来近似这个带约束的优化问题，将其转化为一个无约束的、更容易求解的优化问题。PPO 的目标函数可以看作是 TRPO 目标函数的一阶近似的、加了惩罚项的版本，从而大大简化了计算，同时保留了信赖域方法的稳定性。\n","tags":["Reinforcement Learning"]},{"title":"GNN系列1-GCN(Graph Convolutional Networks)","url":"/2025/01/23/insight/Graphs/Backbones/GCN/","content":"写在前面作为博客开篇，Graph系列的第一章，一切都只是我浅薄的观察和对于阅读的部分论文得出的见解，不能说是insight，只能够尽可能从我自己的武断认为其可能存在的道理来进行剖析，以及，我特别喜欢的，从发展中向后推进、以预判其潜在的改进空间。\n由于是第一章节，所以会牵扯到很多最最基础的定义，烦请耐心阅读。\n另外，就我对于工业界的实习来看，至少在2025年，当下的图结构数据的开发依然存在极其大的空间。在实际应用中发挥图结构的优势，最最重要的是建模，因为图不再是简单的离散点阵，更有图的结构——这也牵扯到什么是图什么是异构图。即，并非再是像朴素数据挖掘那样探讨如何处理图结构的数据来适应一个自回归任务，而是在于应当如何去构建图结构的数据，去定义什么是边，什么是节点，甚至隐式地定义图。一个非常简单的例子，如何教会机器人通过有限旋转关节的机械臂，来叠衣服，如果说这个方法可以通过将空间和衣服本身建模用点来进行建模的话。也许很多人会有和我一样的疑惑：是否图结构的数据在很多的算法中其实都有所崭露，而只是被其他角度的解读所掩盖了。\nGNN作为一个受到MLP和CV中的卷积神经网络的启发，而从深度学习的角度来建模图结构数据的将其作为一个从图数据到目标域的映射，这般的类推是十分朴实的，但是不可避免的需要“具体问题具体分析”——不是一个通用的网络就能够在所有的图相关任务中都达到最好的效果，就像是大语言模型需要在目标域进行微调一样。\n好，那么下面开始。\n参考原文：(GCN-3 KipfNet)Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks ICLR2017 | Paper | Cite代码: torch_geometric.nn.models.GCN\nI. 图结构数据定义常见的定义有二\n\n定义一：基于几何结构数学表示\n\n\\mathcal{G} = (\\mathcal{V},\\mathcal{E})一个图 (\\mathcal{G}) 由以下组成： \n\n节点集合 (\\mathcal{V}): 表示图中的所有节点，通常用 (|\\mathcal{V}| = N) 表示节点的数量。\n边集合 (\\mathcal{E}): 表示节点之间的连接关系，每条边由一对节点 ((u, v) \\in \\mathcal{V} \\times \\mathcal{V}) 表示。 \n节点特征矩阵 (\\mathrm{X}):\\mathrm{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times F}，其中F表示每个节点的特征维度。 \n几何结构(可选): 边的几何信息，如在二维或三维空间中的边的长度、方向等。\n\n形式化表示： \n\n \\mathcal{G} = (\\mathcal{V}, \\mathcal{E}, \\mathrm{X}, \\text{几何信息})示例： \n\n\\mathcal{V} = \\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}；\n\\mathcal{E} = \\{(v_1, v_2), (v_2, v_3)\\}；\n\\mathrm{X}=\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}；\n边的几何长度：d_{12} = 1.5, d_{23} = 2.0。\n\n\n定义二：基于邻接矩阵数学表示：\n\n\\mathcal{G} = (\\mathrm{A}, \\mathrm{X}, \\mathrm{E})一个图\\mathcal{G}可以用以下方式定义：\n\n邻接矩阵 \\mathrm{A}: 表示图的拓扑结构，是一个\\mathrm{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times N}的稀疏矩阵（一般来说），其中：\n\\mathrm{A}_{ij} = 1表示节点i和j之间存在边；\n\\mathrm{A}_{ij} = 0表示节点i和j之间不存在边。\n\n\n节点特征矩阵 \\mathrm{X}: 表示每个节点的特征，是一个\\mathrm{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times F}，其中F表示每个节点的特征维度。\n边特征矩阵 \\mathrm{E}（可选）: 表示边的特征，是一个\\mathrm{E} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|\\mathcal{E}| \\times F_e}，其中F_e表示每条边的特征维度。\n\n形式化表示：\n\n\\mathcal{G} = (\\mathrm{A}, \\mathrm{X}, \\mathrm{E})示例\n\\mathrm{A} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}；\n\n\\mathrm{X} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 0 & 3 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}；\n\n\\mathrm{E} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\\\ 0.8 \\\\ 1.2 \\end{bmatrix}（如边的权重或距离信息 ）。\n\n\n\n定义一关注几何结构，常用于需要明确空间信息的问题，如三维物体重建、分子建模和机器人路径规划，解决几何形状分析、分子性能预测和空间导航等问题；定义二更加关注节点信息和节点间的信息关系，广泛应用于社交网络、推荐系统和知识图谱，主要解决关系建模、个性化推荐以及复杂网络中信息传播与预测的问题。\n当然了在现在的很多工业应用当中抛弃显式的图结构，用简单的神经网络和序列建模Transformer类似的交叉注意力结构也依然能够得到一个非常好的效果，因为大部分工业应用中更加重视速度——尽管这个速度可以是通过学术界新创新方法之后不断地优化得到的。\nII. GCN原理图卷积网络可以分解为层的堆叠，其思路非常简单可以概括为：\n加权平均聚合 \\rightarrow 维度变换 \\rightarrow 非线性激活数学形式如下：\n\n\\mathrm{H}^{(l+1)} = \\sigma\\left( \\tilde{D}^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\tilde{\\mathrm{A}} \\tilde{D}^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\mathrm{H}^{(l)} W^{(l)} \\right) \\tag{2.1}\n\\tilde{\\mathrm{A}} = \\mathrm{A} + I：带自环的邻接矩阵\n\\tilde{D}：\\tilde{A}的度矩阵，\\tilde{D} ^{-\\frac{1}{2}}意味着对于其中所有的非零元素都取正平方根的倒数；\n入度矩阵（有向图，指向该节点的边）：D^{\\text{in}}_{ii} = \\sum_j A_{ji}，\n出度矩阵（有向图，从该节点指出的边）：D^{\\text{out}}_{ii} = \\sum_j A_{ij}，\n\n\nH^{(l)}：第l层的节点特征， H^{(0)} = \\mathrm{X}；\nW^{(l)}：可训练权重矩阵；\n\\sigma：激活函数（如ReLU）。\n\nIII. 不同角度的Rationale可以说，这是通过推广卷积和其上的拉普拉斯算子到图上，来将其变换到频域来进行计算，【Xavier Bresson教授图神经网络系列讲座_bilibili，图神经网络理论基础-人大-魏哲巍_bilibili】这是合理的。也可以从深度学习的角度出发（当然这也是深度卷积网络），所谓浅层表示local，深层表示global信息，即低频率特征值和高频特征值。\n\n关注II部分中的公式.(2.1)中的部分：\n\\tilde{D}^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\tilde{A} \\tilde{D}^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\mathrm{H}^{(l)}本质上就是一个对于邻居节点和自身的加权平均，堆叠GNN的层可以看作是一个信息聚合的过程，如下图所示（有颜色的即为经过这次聚合后能够得到的信息）：\n\n这样的邻居聚合后共享参数其实蕴含了三个假设，\n\n第一，邻居节点和该节点的分类结果是相关的，这一假设与马尔科夫性质（Markov Property）相关，即一个节点的状态只依赖于其邻居节点的状态，也就会引出一些有关于马尔科夫毯（Markov blanket）的讨论，同时也引导人们看向诱导子图（Induced Graph）。\n第二，如果构建的是一个深度GNN，节点间的最短距离和相关性呈反比，即图信号处理中的平滑性假设（Smoothness Assumption）：图信号在局部区域内变化较小，也就是假设图信号的主要信息集中在低频部分，即图信号在局部区域内变化较小；\n第三，假设节点的特征和边的权重是独立的，即边的权重只反映节点之间的连接强度，而不直接依赖于节点特征，这也是为什么GCN原文用的是在社交图上的半监督的节点分类问题。可以说这三个假设是使得GCN这样的模式能够发挥作用的事后解释；也可以说是在发现其存在的问题之后的回顾，对于问题暂且先按下不表，先来看为什么他会有用，以及，是如何设计得更加符合神经网络工学的直觉的。\n\n这和图像卷积中的每次一个滑窗聚合其中的k\\times k的窗口内的像素点；抑或是信号与系统中的空域信号作倒序卷积，都有异曲同工之妙。\n重新定义图卷积（Graph Convolution）回顾一下卷积定义，其中t是连续时域变量，\\tau是窗口大小。\n(f * g)(t):= \\int_{\\infty}f( \\tau )g(t- \\tau )d \\tau离散版本，m 是窗口大小，n 是点列变量（离散时间），n\\in \\mathbb{Z}：\n(f*g)[n]=  \\sum_{m=-\\infty }^ {\\infty}f[m]g[n-m]=  \\sum _ {m=-\\infty }^ {\\infty }  f[n-m]g[m]卷积只是一种频域的分析方法，用滤波器g来筛选原来信号函数f的性质，那么，如何定义Graph上的卷积呢，我们只关注其中的任意一点n，观察对于它卷积的时候发生了什么：假设我们有以下输入信号 f 和卷积核 g：\n\n输入信号 f_n=[1,2,3,4]，索引范围为 0≤m≤3；\n卷积核 g_n=[1,2,1]，索引范围为 0≤m≤2。首先，将卷积核 g 翻转：g_{-m}=[1,2,1]，我们取其中非零的点来计算：\n当 n=3：\n卷积核覆盖的范围：n−m=3⇒m=1,2,3。\n有效范围：m=1,2,3。\n计算得到(f∗g)[3]=f[1]⋅g[2]+f[2]⋅g[1]+f[3]⋅g[0]=2⋅1+3⋅2+4⋅1=12即\\sum^{3}_{m=0} f[m] \\odot g_{-m}[m]，其中\\odot为哈德玛积，即逐个位置元素相乘。\n\n\n\n\n其上得到的是最后整个卷积后得到的函数的其中一个单位点，那么如果我们如果需要在图上定义什么是卷积，就需要定义什么是窗口？以及如何计算整个窗口内的各个元素的相加？\n对于单个节点，他的相邻的数据，显然，就是其相邻的节点，他们靠边来连接，因此很自然地，图卷积的定义就是\n\\tilde{A}\\mathrm{X}就这么简单。\n\n举栗.e.g.将矩阵可视化就是（假设是一个无向的图）：\n\n\n\n\n\\tilde{A}\n节点1\n节点2\n节点3\n节点4\n…\n\n\\mathrm{X}\n节点属性1\n属性2\n…\n\n\n\n\n节点1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n\n\n节点1\nblabla\nlbaba\nlabda\n\n\n节点2\n0\n1\n0\n0\n\n\\cdot\n节点2\nblala\nlbaba\n…\n\n\n节点3\n1\n0\n1\n1\n\n\n节点3\nblaa\nlba\n\n\n\n节点4\n0\n0\n1\n1\n\n\n节点4\nbabla\nlbdab\n\n\n\n…\n\n\n\n\n…\n\n…\n\n\n…\n\n\n\n\n将这个\\tilde{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times N}和\\mathrm{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times F}矩阵点积后可以得到更新后的\\mathrm{X}' \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times F}\n其中（比如第一个节点的更新后的第一个属性，关注红色的行和列哈德玛积后相加），\n\\forall x'_i \\in \\mathrm{X}', x_j \\in N(j),x'_i = \\sum_{j} x_j.这里N(j)表示和原图中的节点x_j的1-hop邻居节点。\n\n那具体的步骤解释了，如何形式分析和定义呢？指路这家：图神经网络(GNN)入门之旅(三)-拉普拉斯矩阵与GCN - 知乎 (zhihu.com)；（看里面怎么定义拉普拉斯的就够了嗷，不要贪杯= ^ =）。简述就是希望模仿二维离散的拉普拉斯算子（如下），来推广图上的卷积和频谱分析：\n\\begin{pmatrix}  \n0 & 1  & 0  \\\\\n1 & -4  & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1  & 0 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}最最重要的是以下的这句话：\n“”假设具有 N 个节点的图 \\mathcal{G} ，此时图中每个节点的自由度至多为 N ，此时该图为完全图，即任意两个节点之间都有一条边连接，则对其中一个节点进行微扰，它可能变为图中任意一个节点。 \n此时以上定义的函数 f 不再是二维，而是 N 维向量： f=(f_1,f_2,...,f_N) ，其中 f_i 为函数 f 在图中节点 x_i 处的函数值。类比于二维函数 f(x,y) 在节点 (x,y) 处的值。 \n对 i 节点进行扰动，它可能变为任意一个与它相邻的节点 j∈N(i) , N(i) 表示节点 i 的一阶邻域节点。 \n我们上面已经知道拉普拉斯算子可以计算一个点到它所有自由度上微小扰动的增益，则通过图来表示就是任意一个节点 j 变化到节点 i 所带来的增益……“”\n也就是：图卷积是定义在图的边结构上的卷积，而 x_i \\sim p(X)，所有的节点都是来自于一个分布的采样；这其实也和其他的离散的信号定义保持了一致，但是其奥妙在于他是基于边的结构的卷积。\n\n但是显然地，我们会发现一个问题，在CV中，假设从函数的角度出发来看张量的变化，CNN(\\cdot) := f(x), x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{H \\times W \\times C} ，其输入和输出的张量形状是不一致的，即x^{(k)}= f(x^{(k-1)}), k≥1 的时候 (H^k \\times W^k) \\propto \\frac{1}{k} ，也就是如果不padding的话，CNN的张量随着网络深度的增加是越来越小的。但是GNN并非如此，GNN(\\cdot) := f(x), x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times F}, x^{(k)}= f(x^{(k-1)}), k≥1 的时候， N^k = N^{k-1},始终都是节点的个数，那自然会出现问题：也就是（当然并没有那么显然哦，只是我说的）GCN会遇到的，过渡平滑。\nIV. 图信号过渡平滑拉普拉斯平滑原理在图信号处理中，过渡平滑可通过图拉普拉斯矩阵量化，GCN传播一次的数学表达式为：\n\n\\mathcal{S}(f) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i,j=1}^n A_{ij} \\| f_i - f_j \\|^2 = f^\\top L f\nf_i, f_j，就是上述的Section.III的最后的引言部分的定义，对于每个节点的变换后的值；\nf \\in \\mathbb{R}^n，图信号向量；\nL = D - A， （姑且这样定义，也可以是归一化后的）组合拉普拉斯矩阵。因为拉普拉斯矩阵就是来刻画局部的平滑度，详见图像中运用了拉普拉斯核后的图像。\n\n平滑传播过程在图卷积网络中，多层传播导致的平滑效应可表示为：\n\nH^{(k+1)} = P H^{(k)} \\quad \\text{其中} \\quad P = \\tilde{D}^{-1/2}\\tilde{A}\\tilde{D}^{-1/2}对传播矩阵P（因为假设是拉普拉斯矩阵）进行特征分解：  \nP = U \\Lambda U^\\top经过K次传播后：  \nH^{(K)} = P^K H^{(0)} = U \\Lambda^K U^\\top H^{(0)}平滑动态特性那么自然地，从单个特征值的角度来看：\n\n高频分量衰减：\\lambda_i^K \\rightarrow 0 \\ (\\text{当}\\ |\\lambda_i| < 1)；\n低频分量保留：\\lambda_i^K \\rightarrow 1 \\ (\\text{当}\\ \\lambda_i \\approx 1)。\n\n过度平滑的数学描述当传播次数K \\rightarrow \\infty时，信号收敛至：  \n\\lim_{K \\to \\infty} P^K = \\frac{\\phi \\phi^\\top}{\\|\\phi\\|^2}其中\\phi是P的主特征向量，导致节点特征趋同：  \nH^{(\\infty)} \\propto \\phi \\cdot \\text{const}或者这样表示：\n\n设 h_i^{(k)} 表示节点 i 在第 k 层的特征；\n如果对于任意两个节点 i 和 j，有：\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} \\|h_i^{(k)} - h_j^{(k)}\\| = 0或者通过方差来刻画： \\text{Var}(H^{(k)}) \\to 0 \\quad \\text{当} \\quad k \\to \\infty\n\nV. 小结Kipf的GCN其实不是GCN的最初的频谱分析的流派的继承，而是做出了简单而且大胆的创新，虽然一开始是无向图，但是可以推广到有向图；\n其次是它的计算本质上是可以很快的，因为一切都取决于GPU上对于矩阵的点积操作的优化，但是，在大规模图上他的内存复杂消耗会到 O(N^2) 因为相当于直接存入邻接矩阵，而且稀疏图一般都是用链表或者是字典结构数据来存储的，因此不同存储的转化也存在加速的可能性；\n模型不具有随机性，没有独属于Graph的结构的数据增强和适合图的随机性对于方差的扩充。也就是，模型的泛化性不足 ———— 在OOD和存在分布偏移的数据上的泛化能力不足、对于动态图的适应能力较差。可以说这是由于他是transductive（直推）的，但是我不喜欢这种说辞，因为后续所谓提出inductive（归纳）方式解决了这个问题的GraphSAGE，实际上在动态图或者是分布差异的数据上的表现也不佳。\n虽然这也是其他所有的想要作更好的representation learning的模型的通病，这也有待后续的更多博客来探讨。博客文笔见疏，诸君评论多加指正。\n","tags":["Graph","GNN"]}]
